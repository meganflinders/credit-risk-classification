# credit-risk-classification
# The purpose of this analysis is to build a model that lending services companies can use in order to identify risky borrowers.
# Using historical financial data and machine learning, Logistic Regression Models were created in order to make predictions on whether or not borrowers are likely to default on their loans. 
# Summary:
#   I would recommend using the second logistic regression model with Random Oversampler, as it was much more accurate at predicting high-risk loans, as well as healthy loans with 99% precision. While the first model predicted the healthy loans with 100% precision, it only predicted the high-risk loans with 87% precision, meaning that the second model is more accurate overall.
